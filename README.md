This repo contains solutions for problems that I came across during my studies, conversations with friends, or while browsing through the internet.

These problems mostly require some mathematical background as well as ability to correctly code the solutions.

1 Vampire problem: some n residents live isolated on an island. Each night, a Vampire comes and kills exactly one of them. The people this way are bound to die in n days. You have a special power to save some of them. Before each night, you can poison some residents. They die the next morning, but if the Vampire kills one of them (since it drinks the poisoned blood), it also dies, and the remaining residents live happily ever after. You want to maximize the number of survivors. With the optimal strategy, how many residents do you give poison to before the first night?
